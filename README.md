# science-project-fifth-grade

My science project from fifth grade (2004), revamped for modern data science 20 years later (2024).

I found this project while digging around an old bankers box. I transcribed the data and set up a modern data science-y exploration as a single [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebook. There are only a handful of examples, but it's fun to poke around a dataset I personally harvested as a kid at a time when I knew nothing about math, science, engineering, and software.

## Usage

Run

```sh
marimo run science.py
```

## Setup

Create and activate a `venv`. Then run

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
